# Multi-Job Simulation Implementation

## Summary

We've enhanced the dsHPC API with a powerful new feature for batch processing of jobs. The multi-job simulation API allows users to submit multiple job configurations in a single request, process them in parallel, and receive consolidated results with statistics.

## Key Components Implemented

1. **New Models**:
   - `JobConfig`: For individual job configurations
   - `MultiJobSimulationRequest`: For batch job requests
   - `MultiJobResult`: For detailed job results
   - `MultiJobSimulationResponse`: For consolidated batch response

2. **New Services**:
   - `simulate_multiple_jobs`: To process job configurations in parallel
   - `process_single_job`: A wrapper for single job simulation that adds input parameters to results

3. **New API Endpoint**:
   - `POST /simulate-jobs`: For batch processing of job simulations

4. **Testing**:
   - Created test scripts for uploading files and testing the multi-job API
   - Added error handling and safe value extraction
   - Successfully tested the complete workflow

## Technical Features

- **Parallel Processing**: Uses asyncio to process all jobs concurrently
- **Intelligent Job Handling**:
  - For completed jobs: Returns status and output
  - For in-progress jobs: Returns status without output
  - For failed jobs: Resubmits and returns both statuses
  - For nonexistent jobs: Submits new job and returns status
- **Comprehensive Statistics**:
  - Total jobs processed
  - Successful submissions
  - Failed submissions
  - Completed jobs
  - In-progress jobs
  - Resubmitted jobs
- **Robust Error Handling**:
  - Gracefully handles missing methods
  - Provides detailed error messages
  - Safely extracts values from potentially null objects

## Documentation

- Created detailed documentation in `MULTI_JOB_SIMULATION.md`
- Provided API request and response formats
- Included examples in Python and curl
- Documented the job status logic and error handling

## Usage

The API can be used for various scenarios:
- Running the same method across multiple datasets
- Running multiple methods on the same dataset
- Any combination of methods and datasets
- Automating batch job submissions and tracking

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements could include:
- Adding pagination for large result sets
- Supporting job prioritization
- Adding batch job cancellation
- Implementing batch job status polling
- Supporting job dependencies (jobs that depend on other jobs)
