# dsHPC Docker Network Security

We've improved the security of the dsHPC system by implementing proper network isolation, exposing only the necessary API endpoint to the outside world while keeping all other services protected within an internal network.

## Changes Implemented

1. **Network Isolation**
   - Created an internal network (`dshpc-internal-network`) that is not accessible from the host
   - All services (MongoDB databases, Slurm API) are only accessible within this network
   - Created a public network (`dshpc-public-network`) for the API service only

2. **Port Configuration**
   - Removed all exposed ports except for the main API
   - Made the API's external port configurable via environment variables
   - Set fixed internal ports for clarity and simplicity

3. **Documentation**
   - Created detailed documentation on the network architecture
   - Provided instructions for customizing the external port
   - Added guidance for debugging network issues

## Benefits

### Security Improvements

- **Reduced Attack Surface**: Only one service (the API) is accessible from outside
- **Protected Databases**: MongoDB instances are completely isolated from external access
- **Single Entry Point**: All external requests must go through the API, which can implement proper authentication and authorization

### Operational Improvements

- **Port Flexibility**: The external API port can be changed without modifying code
- **Simplified Configuration**: Internal ports are standardized and fixed
- **Clear Network Boundaries**: Services are explicitly grouped by network

## How to Test Security

1. **API Access Test**
   ```bash
   # Should return {"status":"ok"}
   curl -s http://localhost:8001/health
   ```

2. **Internal Service Access Test**
   ```bash
   # Should fail with connection timeout or refused
   curl -s --max-time 2 http://localhost:27017
   ```

3. **Network Inspection**
   ```bash
   # View the internal network configuration
   docker network inspect dshpc-internal-network
   
   # View the public network configuration 
   docker network inspect dshpc-public-network
   ```

## Further Security Enhancements

For additional security, consider:

1. **API Authentication**: Implement authentication for the API
2. **HTTPS**: Configure the API to use HTTPS with proper certificates
3. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. **Firewall Rules**: Configure host-level firewall rules for added protection
5. **Container Hardening**: Review container security settings, such as running containers with non-root users

These changes have significantly improved the security posture of the dsHPC system by implementing proper network isolation and following the principle of least privilege.
